# Decision Tree Implementations

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating the practical application of decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

## Project Files

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier Implementation

**File:** `Decision-Tree-Classifier-Practical-Implementation.ipynb`

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a Decision Tree Classifier. It covers:

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Loading the dataset (likely the Iris dataset)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature scaling and encoding

- **Model Implementation:**
  - Importing necessary libraries (sklearn, pandas, numpy)
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
  - Creating and training the DecisionTreeClassifier

- **Visualization:**
  - Plotting the decision tree structure
  - Feature importance visualization

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Generating a confusion matrix
  - Cross-validation for model performance assessment

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimal parameters

### 2. Diabetes Prediction Using Decision Tree Regressor

**File:** `Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Regressor.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates the application of a Decision Tree Regressor for predicting diabetes progression. It includes:

- **Data Handling:**
  - Loading the diabetes dataset
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature selection and engineering

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Statistical summary of the dataset
  - Correlation analysis
  - Visualization of key features

- **Model Development:**
  - Importing required libraries
  - Splitting data into features (X) and target variable (y)
  - Training the DecisionTreeRegressor model

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score
  - Cross-validation to assess model stability
  - Feature importance analysis

- **Prediction and Interpretation:**
  - Making predictions on test data
  - Interpreting the results in the context of diabetes progression
